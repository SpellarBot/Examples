Synopsis

This presentation is on Polymorphism and Ruby.
In this different ways to acheive polymorphism is explained with the help of examples.
The different ways to acheive the polymorphism need to be understand.

For Example in Ruby if u type in irb as 1.to_i & "1".to_i 
Both of this statements will not raise any error
So can you think how a string and an integer will calll the same method without raising an exception.
This is working in ruby bz of Polymorphism, as in Ruby "Everything is an object"
and all the objects having a paticular properties.

"Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types."

While in ruby this can be explained as, 
Polymorphism :In Ruby polymorphism means able to send the same message to different objects and get different results.

A few different ways to achieve this:
    1) Inheritance
    2) Duck typing
    3) Decorator pattern
    4) Single Responsibility Principle
